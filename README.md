# :scroll: Django Cheat Sheet
A cheat-sheet for creating web apps with the Django framework using the Python language. Most of the summaries and examples are based on [the official documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/) for Django v2.0.

## :snake: Initializing pipenv (optional)
- Make main folder with `$ mkdir <folder>` and navigate to it with `$ cd <folder>`
- Initialize pipenv with `$ pipenv install`
- Enter pipenv shell with `$ pipenv shell`
- Install django with `$ pipenv install django`
- Install other package dependencies with `$ pipenv install <package_name>`

## :blue_book: Creating a project
- Navigate to main folder with `$ cd <folder>`
- Create project with `$ django-admin startproject <project_name>`

The project directory should look like this:
```
project/
    manage.py
    project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
```
- Run the development server with `$ python manage.py runserver` within the project directory
- If you want your `SECRET_KEY` to be more secure, you can set it to reference an environment variable
- In the `settings.py` file within the project directory change the `SECRET_KEY` line to the following:
```python
SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')
```
- To quickly generate a random hex for your secret key:
```python
>>> import secrets
>>> secrets.token_hex()
```
- You can set this environment variable in your shell with `export SECRET_KEY=<secret_key>`

## :page_with_curl: Creating an app
- Navigate to the outer project folder  `$ cd <outer_project_folder>`
- Create app with  `$ python manage.py startapp <app_name>`
- Inside the `app` folder, create a file called `urls.py`

The project directory should now look like this:
```
project/
    manage.py
    db.sqlite3
    project/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    app/
        migrations/
            __init__.py
        __init__.py
        admin.py
        apps.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        urls.py
        views.py
```
- To include this app in your project, add your app to the project's `settings.py` file by adding its name to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'app',
	# ...
]
```
- To migrate changes over:
```bash
$ python manage.py migrate
```

## :tv: Creating a view
- Within the app directory, open `views.py` and add the following:
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, World!")
```
- Still within the app directory, open (or create)  `urls.py` 
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]
```
- Now within the project directory, edit `urls.py` to include the following
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('app/', include('app.urls')),
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
```
- To create a url pattern to the index of the site, use the following urlpattern:
```python
urlpatterns = [
    path("", include('app.urls')),
]
```
- Remember: there are multiple files named `urls.py`
- The `urls.py` file within app directories are organized by the `urls.py` found in the project folder.

## :art: Creating a template
- Within the app directory, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are located within the following locations:
```
app/
   templates/
      index.html
   static/
      style.css
      script.js
```
- To add a template to views, open `views.py` within the app directory and include the following:
```python
from django.shortcuts import render

def index(request):
    return render(request,'index.html')
```
- To include context to the template:
```python
def index(request):
	context = {"context_variable": context_variable}
    return render(request,'index.html', context)
```
- Within the HTML file, you can reference static files by adding the following:
```html
{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
		
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'styles.css' %}">
	</head>
</html>
```
- To make sure to include the following in your `settings,py`:
```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
	os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static")
]
```
- To add an `extends`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html'%}

{% block content %}

Hello, World!

{% endblock %}
```
- And then in `base.html` add:
```html
<body>
	{% block content %}{% endblock %}
</body>
```

## :ticket: Creating a model
- Within the app's `models.py` file, an example of a simple model can be added with the following:
```python
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
	first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
	last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
```
*Note that you don't need to create a primary key, Django automatically adds an IntegerField.*

- To perform changes in your models, use the following commands in your shell:
```
$ python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>
$ python manage.py migrate
```
*Note: including <app_name> is optional.*
- A one-to-many relationship can be made with a `ForeignKey`:
```python
class Musician(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    instrument = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Album(models.Model):
    artist = models.ForeignKey(Musician, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    release_date = models.DateField()
    num_stars = models.IntegerField()
```
- In this example, to query for the set of albums of a musician:
```python
>>> m = Musician.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> a = m.album_set.get()
```
 
- A many-to-many relationship can be made with a `ManyToManyField`:
```python
class Topping(models.Model):
    # ...
    pass

class Pizza(models.Model):
    # ...
    toppings = models.ManyToManyField(Topping)
```
*Note that the `ManyToManyField`  is **only defined in one model**. It doesn't matter which model has the field, but if in doubt, it should be in the model that will be interacted with in a form.*

- Although Django provides a `OneToOneField` relation, a one-to-one relationship can also be defined by adding the kwarg of `unique = True` to a model's `ForeignKey`:
```python
ForeignKey(SomeModel, unique=True)
```
	
- For more detail, the [official documentation for database models]( https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/db/models/) provides a lot of useful information and examples.

## :postbox: Creating model objects and queries
- Example `models.py` file:
```python
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    tagline = models.TextField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Author(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    email = models.EmailField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Entry(models.Model):
    blog = models.ForeignKey(Blog, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    headline = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    body_text = models.TextField()
    pub_date = models.DateField()
    mod_date = models.DateField()
    authors = models.ManyToManyField(Author)
    n_comments = models.IntegerField()
    n_pingbacks = models.IntegerField()
    rating = models.IntegerField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.headline
```
- To create an object within the shell:
```
$ python manage.py shell
```
```python
>>> from blog.models import Blog
>>> b = Blog(name='Beatles Blog', tagline='All the latest Beatles news.')
>>> b.save()
```
- To save a change in an object:
```python
>>> b.name = 'The Best Beatles Blog'
>>> b.save()
```
- To retrieve objects:
```python
>>> all_entries = Entry.objects.all()
>>> indexed_entry = Entry.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> find_entry = Entry.objects.filter(name='Beatles Blog')
```

## :man: Using the Admin page
- To create a `superuser`:
```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
- To add a model to the Admin page include the following in `admin.py`:
```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Author, Book

admin.site.register(Author)
admin.site.register(Book)
```
## :leaves: Use MongoDB (optional)
- installing djongo lib
```bash
$ pip install djongo
```
- Change these settings in the **settings.py** file on your project
```python

DATABASES = {
   'default': {
      'ENGINE' : 'djongo',
      
       'NAME' : 'db_name',
        'CLIENT': {
            'host': 'mongodb://localhost:27017',
        }
   }
}
```
